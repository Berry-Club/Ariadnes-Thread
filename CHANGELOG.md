# 1.0.0

- Initial release

# 1.1.0

- The thread line now renders after weather, rather than after particles
- Color gradient is now configurable
- Reformatted the configs
- The thread now aims at the center of your body rather than at your head
- Fixed the mod on dedicated servers, so it doesn't try to load clientside-only classes

# 1.1.1

- Removed the Mod Scheduler as it isn't used for anything. I probably used it at some point and then decided it wasn't needed.
